# Recipes
This repository is for acceleration program in Sweeft Digital. The project is about recipes and its management.

Project is to express front-end skills on **Angular**. 
The back-end used is **json server**, it is time consuming mocked server-side.

Project covers some topics like: **Components** and their management, **Services** and their use, while communicating with server, **Some mark-up skills based on html,css**, I have used some bootstrap also. Created interface of **Recipe** and **User** to handle data flow. 

To be able to use some features, For example adding new recipe, you need to authorize by clicking "შესვლა" and I have set the User's credentials:
**Name**: sweeft
**Password**: test
If you check my **db.json** file, you see defined user.

In order, to execute and see my work do the following -> locate to My_App file and run the following command: **ng serve** (This will only execute the front-end, without any data). After this, open another terminal and locate into the same directory (My_App) and run the following command: **yarn serve-json**. 
This will make data load and the last step is to sign in with give **Name and Password** to be able to see all the features.
